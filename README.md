## Description
This Project was coded in the scope of the "CS-108: Practice of Object Oriented Programming" at EPFL.
All the material provided aswell as the project assignment and weekly assignment material can be found [here](https://cs108.epfl.ch/archive/18/archive.html) (https://cs108.epfl.ch/archive/18/archive.html). (The raw files can also be found in the the `provided_material_and_assignments` folder)

This repository contains an emulator coded in java of the original gameboy released in 1989 by Nintendo.

The emulator is able to run ROM files of games designed for the original 1989 gameboy.

## How to get started
Executing the java program in ```GamebojProject\src\ch\epfl\gameboj\gui\Main.java``` will open a Menu window, where it is possible to observe and change the key bindings/controls and review screenshots taken in the game.
The menu also contains a list of pre-downloaded .gb ROM files of original gameboy games you can select and play by clicking on them.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `games`: the folder containsthe pre-downloaded ROM files for gameboy games, aswell any screenshots you may take within the game.
- `provided_material_and_assignments`: raw files of provided material and assignments for this project.
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependencies
- Java SDK 11 or above
- Java FX for java sdk 11 or above

Setting up java FX can be tricky, you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67COH9F718&t=317s) youtube tutorial if you are using visual studio code on windows.

## Skills
Java, Java FX, Object Oriented Programming, Deep understanding of how the original gameboy processed and executed ROM files.
