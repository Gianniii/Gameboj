## Description
This Project was coded in the scope of the "CS-108: Practice of Object Oriented Programming" at EPFL.
All the material provided aswell as the project assignment and weekly assignment material can be found [here](https://cs108.epfl.ch/archive/18/archive.html) (https://cs108.epfl.ch/archive/18/archive.html). (The raw files can also be found in the the `provided_material_and_assignments` folder)

This repository contains an emulator coded in java of the original gameboy released in 1989 by Nintendo.

## How to get started
Executing the java program in ```GamebojProject\src\ch\epfl\gameboj\gui\Main.java``` will open a Menu window, where it is possible to observe and change the key bindings/controls and review screenshots taken in the game.
The menu also contains a list of pre-downloaded .gb ROM files of original gameboy games you can select and play by clicking on them.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `games`: the folder containsthe pre-downloaded ROM files for gameboy games, aswell any screenshots you may take within the game.
- `provided_material_and_assignments`: raw files of provided material and assignments for this project.
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependencies
Java SDK 11 or above
Java FX for java sdk 11 or above

Setting up java FX can be tricky, you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67COH9F718&t=317s) youtube tutorial if you are using visual studio code on windows.

## Skills
